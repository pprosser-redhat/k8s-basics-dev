The web console for a Kubernetes cluster can be used to display a visual representation, in your browser, of what resources have been created and the relationship between them,by way of a tease here is a screenshot of what it looks like:

image::deployments-console.png[Deployments, 800]

Most developers will interact with a Kubernetes cluster from the command line using `kubectl`.

To see a list of all the deployments in the current namespace which have already been created, run:

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl get deployment
----


This should yield output:

[.console-output]
[source]
----
NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
mongodb-community-server    1/1     1            1           15m
nationalparks-py            1/1     1            1           9m2s
parksmap                    2/2     2            2           14m
workspace1dfffd9cfbe34c7d   1/1     1            1           20m
----

NOTE: The deployment starting with the name 'workspace' can be ignored. This deployment is hosting the web terminal window you are using. 


To narrow in on a specific resource, the name of that resource can be added to the command:


[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl get deployment/parksmap
----

This should then yield output for just the one resource.

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
parksmap   2/2     2            2           15m
----

NOTE: The numbers you see might be different to those shown above

To see much more detailed information about a resource `kubectl describe` can be used.

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl describe deployment/parksmap
----

For a deployment, just the start of what you should see is:

[.console-output]
[source]
----

This is still in a semi human readable form and isn't suitable for machine processing. To instead see the raw resource definition, you can use the `-o yaml` display output option to `kubectl get`.

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl get deployment/parksmap -o yaml
----

Or if you prefer to work with JSON rather than YAML, you can use:

[.console-input]
[source, execute]
----
kubectl get deployment/parksmap  -o json
----
